Blackfield is a hard level box on HackTheBox and requires basic Active Directory knowledge and enumeration skills to solve. The user part was rather lengthy, but with the use of Bloodhound, the path to root becomes clear very early on.

## Walkthrough

A basic and full port nmap scan, followed by a script scan on the ports found reveals the following information

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HackTheBox/Blackfield]
â””â”€# nmap -p 53,88,139,139,389,445,593,3268 -sVC blackfield.htb

```

The open Kerberos and DNS services imply that this box is likely to be a domain controller. Enumeration via `enum4linux` is unsuccessful, but we do have anonymous access to some SMB shares. While the IPC$ share is empty, the profiles$ share seems interesting and is actually filled with folders of what seem to be usernames in a first initial + last name naming format.

After doing a recursive download of all the files and directories, it becomes clear that the real interesting thing to note is the actual folders, not their nonexistent contents. They fit the candidate for potential usernames, so we can compile them into a wordlist and then attempt to spray them with weak credentials or use an AS-REP Roasting attack (since Kerberos is running, its worth a shot.). When I ran the recursive download on smbclient, all the folders were placed in the directory I ran smbclient in. This allowed me to just compile a wordlist using `ls > userlist`. With the userlist compiled, let's start with an AS-REP Roast.

```

[-] User svc_backup doesn't have UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set

```

While many of the usernames were actually invalid, we did find three valid users (svc_backup, audit2020, and support), and a hash for one. Something to note is the audit user; previously, when we enumerated SMB shares, there was a "forensic" folder that this audit user likely has access to. Moving on, we can crack the hash with hashcat on mode 18200 after writing the hash to a file, and this yields us the following information

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€DESKTOP-VBI49KD)-[/mnt/d/Downloads]
â””â”€# hashcat -a 0 -m 18200 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force

$krb5asrep$23$support@BLACKFIELD.LOCAL:6c4abb99a36faa761188bf7118998eb1$1e2c1afa5619bcee910235a29447654c66fc1dfeb415562db72a23aec206578c0482e32d03f38e5912f9994c9e88528f7e581b70998dbf1dd349375b352f095679c8be7726320857e77eba96c449868979412296fbec8c9848ced7cff89056e3a3efb8dcd50c1893dc34fe2df84875d4745d8dca718f60cd7353e141c7dc9d51a69cf85a3ee788a35eb4099577f2c026ac3fd6b8127ed78d2d487a9bda31d4fd65b5984fa0116f8c47549713c1421672f70be43383d6d76bc9ddc93760eff85b62dc4e100829241a5e777793dbb502c7f6db7a1c0cada3b71c80f7a6bfe07f78f2cfec5b43fa489f3df7cfd743e64f2bd5b30851:
#00^BlackKnight
```

Now that we have valid credentials, we can use Evil-WinRM to get remote access through the WinRM service.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali]
â””â”€# evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.192 -u 'support' -p '#00^BlackKnight' 

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3
Warning: Remote path completions is disabled due to ruby limitation: quoting_detection_proc() function is unimplemented on this machine

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint
Error: An error of type WinRM::WinRMAuthorizationError happened, message is WinRM::WinRMAuthorizationError

```

Turns out this doesn't work. This is likely because this user isn't in the "Remote Management Users" group, which is needed if a user is to try to gain access through the WinRM service. In other words, the service can only be used by users in that group. We can confirm this by running bloodhound (plus this helps us enumerate even further, now that we have access to an actual user).

```

```

It turns out we're correct. Checking for information on the other users we found yields the following graphs

<img src="https://github.com/susMdT/Nigerald/blob/master/assets/images/Blackfield_Bloodhound.PNG?raw=true" class="postImagecontent" width="100%" height="100%" unselectable="on" />

First thing to note is that our user, support, can change the password for the user audit2020. There is also another user, svc_backup, which is in the Backup Operators group. Members of this group usually have the SeBackupPivilege and SeRestorePrivilege, allowing them to read any files. Since we want to obtain control over the domain, we would read the NTDS.dit and the System hive (more on this later). To start our attack path, lets start by resetting the password of audit2020. While we don't have code exeuction on the computer to do this, we can use the MSRPC service to our advantage. 

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/GithubTools/impacket]
â””â”€# rpcclient -U 'support%#00^BlackKnight' 10.10.10.192                                                             
rpcclient $> setuserinfo audit2020 23 'OrbitalNumber1'

//The 23 specifies the command to use the privilege information of the user we authenticated as, and because user //support has the privilege to overwrite the audit user's password, this works.
```

Our suspicions from earlier turn out to be true; we can read from the forensic share.

```

While trying to exfiltrate the files from the share, they turned out to be too large so I ended up just mounting the share onto my own host.

```

The most interesting file here is the lsass.zip. Lsass is a built in Windows service that manages the security policies, the verification of logins, and other authentication related processes. We don't have write access in the share, but we can just copy it out of the share and extract it via `cp lsass.zip /path/to/some/directory && 7z e /path/to/copy`. This nets us a Mini DuMP dump file that we will extract information from using the tool pypykatz (we can install this simply with pip3 install pypykatz).

We can simply test if these hashes are valid by passing the NT hash into Evil-WinRM. Only the svc_backup account is able to authenticate.

We're in! And we also have both of the privileges needed for our Privilege Escalation that I detailed earlier. When a computer is a Domain Controller in an AD network, the local accounts are disabled, so we if want Admin access, we need the Ntds.dit file. Additionally, the key needed to decrypt this and actually extract information is located in the System hive (a group of keys, subkeys, and values located in the registry). However, because the Ntds is always in use, we cannot simply just make a backup of it. To start our attack process, we will create a dsh (Diskshadow script); the Diskshadow tool can create shadow files, which are like snapshots. For convenience and mitigation of potential errors, we will script out our commands. We will create a .dsh and input the following lines of code:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HackTheBox/Blackfield]
â””â”€# nano bruh.dsh

//in the file
set context persistent nowriters
add volume c: alias bruh
create
expose %bruh% d:

//Now encode the file to the correct format
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HackTheBox/Blackfield]
â””â”€# unix2dos bruh.dsh
unix2dos: converting file bruh.dsh to DOS format...
```

In this script, we are creating a copy of the C: drive, aliasing as "bruh", and then creating a D drive based on "bruh". Additionally, this D drive will remain even after the Diskshadow program is done running. Now we upload the file in our Evil-WinRM session and then copy (using robocopy, since normal copy won't take into account our privileges). While theoretically we could just use robocopy to read the root flag and not do all this extra stuff, we're here for Administrator, not the flag.

```

I had to create a directory and run the script in the new directory because I ran into issues regarding write access in the directory that I ran the script in. Now that we have a copy of Ntds.dit that isn't in constant use, we can copy it with robocopy.

```
//We are copying the snapshot of ntds into our own directory under the name ntds.dit 
//the /b flag tells it to utilize our SeBackupPrivilege
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Tmp> robocopy /b d:\windows\ntds . ntds.dit 
100%

```

Now that we have our data, we need the key (the system hive).

```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Tmp> reg save hklm\system system
The operation completed successfully
```

Now we just have to download both files for offline cracking with secretsdump.py, a tool apart of impacket.

```
//Normally you could just use "download <filename" in Evil-WinRM, but it wasn't working so I spun up an SMB server and copied them there

And now we just have to pass the NTLM hash (the hash on the right of the colon), and we win.

## Afterthoughts

This box was super fun; not too difficult and brain draining, but long and memorable enough to learn some things. Bloodhound really stuck out to me on this one, as I was able to essentially map my entire attack path very early on. The entire attack chain made sense, and enumeration was essential; however, because of Bloodhound, enumeration was extremely easy because everything else was noticeably out of place (such as the forensic share having a description that included the name of an account in SMB).
